 The objective of this project is to experiment with the fundamentals of the software development process and consolidate the contents of this semester.

 It is important to note that, as a learning tool, with this project we are not particularly interested in delivering the project per se, but on using it to better fixate the concepts we might encounter in our classes. During the development we will explore and experiment with these concepts meaning that we might try out things even if they are not the most efficient way of doing it.

We are aware of the limitations of our application imposed by time constraints and the volume of work one must expect from the final weeks of a graduation program.

To assist on the creation of the GUI for our project we used the Blazorise library, which contains the blueprints of components based on Bootstrap.

We used Microsoft's SQL Server Management System as our Database.
